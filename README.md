# Final-Project


Group Members: Nandhini Natrayan, Yaren Merve Akin

Subject: Prediction of students dropout and its influential parameters

Adjective: how the student dropout is influenced by the importance feature based on our dataset. Machine Learning algorithms that are going to be used in this project are the logistics Algorithm, Decision Tree Classifier,Kneigherestneibhours.

Description of the Data: We gathered the data from Kaggle.The dataset contains 4424 observations and 35 variables. Independent variables contain information about students and the Dependent variable refers to student performance.

High level plan for the week:

DAY 1 : EDA ( rename columns, lowercase, drop unwanted columns, filling NA, finding nulls, cleaning the rows and the names, unique values, unique counts, removing the outliers, standardize the data)
DAY 2 : Data cleaning, removing the wrong data types, checking the correlation between the input features.
DAY 3 : Machine learning model will be applied.
DAY 4 - 5 : Creating the presentation for the project.
DAY 6 : Getting ready for the presentation.
